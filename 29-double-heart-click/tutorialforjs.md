Roadmap To Rewrite The JavaScript Yourself:

**1. Select Elements:**

- Use `document.querySelector(".loveMe")` to select the element with the class ".loveMe" and store it in a variable called `loveMe`.
- Use `document.querySelector("#times")` to select the element with the ID "#times" and store it in a variable called `times`.

**2. Initialize Variables:**

- Create a variable called `clickTime` and initialize it to `0`. This will track the timestamp of the last click.
- Create another variable called `timesClicked` and initialize it to `0`. This will count the number of double clicks.

**3. Add Event Listener:**

- Attach an event listener to the `loveMe` element using `addEventListener("click", (e) => { ... })`. The callback function `(e)` will receive the click event object (`e`).

**4. Double Click Detection:**

- Inside the event listener, use an `if` statement:
  - If `clickTime` is `0`, it's the first click. Set `clickTime` to the current timestamp using `new Date().getTime()`.
- Otherwise, check if the difference between the current timestamp and `clickTime` is less than 800 milliseconds using another `if` statement:
  - If the difference is less than 800 milliseconds (considered a double click), call a function named `createHeart` and pass the event object (`e`) as an argument. Reset `clickTime` to `0`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met (a single click or too much time between clicks), simply reset `clickTime` to the current timestamp.

**5. Create Heart Function:**

- Define a function called `createHeart(e)`. This function takes the event object (`e`) as an argument.
  - Inside the function:
    - Create a new element of type `<i>` using `document.createElement("i")`. Store it in a variable called `heart`.
    - Add classes "fas" and "fa-heart" to the `heart` element using `classList.add`. These classes likely reference an icon library (like Font Awesome) to display a heart icon.
    - Calculate the click position within the entire window:
      - Get the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the click (`e.clientX` and `e.clientY`) and store them in `x` and `y` variables.
    - Calculate the click position relative to the clicked element:
      - Get the left and top offsets of the clicked element (`e.target.offsetLeft` and `e.target.offsetTop`) and store them in `leftOffset` and `topOffset` variables.
      - Calculate the X and Y coordinates relative to the clicked element by subtracting the offsets from the click position (`x - leftOffset` and `y - topOffset`) and store them in `xInside` and `yInside` variables.
    - Use DOM manipulation to dynamically set the style of the `heart` element:
      - Set the `top` and `left` styles using `heart.style.top = `${yInside}px"` and `heart.style.left = `${xInside}px"`. This positions the heart icon at the click location relative to the clicked element.
    - Append the created `heart` element to the `loveMe` element using `loveMe.appendChild(heart)`. This adds the heart icon to the page.
    - Update the number of double clicks:
      - Access the content of the `times` element using `times.innerHTML`.
      - Increment the `timesClicked` counter (`++timesClicked`).
      - Set the content of the `times` element back to the updated count.
    - Use `setTimeout` to schedule the removal of the heart icon after 1 second:
      - Pass an arrow function as the first argument to `setTimeout`. This function removes the `heart` element using `heart.remove()`.
      - Set the delay to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) as the second argument to `setTimeout`.
