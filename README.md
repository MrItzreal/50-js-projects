I decided to invest in myself and purchased the "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" course by @florinpop1705 & @traversymedia to sharpen my fundamentals. 

My goal is to complete multiple projects each day until I finish the course. I will take my time to ensure I truly understand each project before moving on to the next. After completing the course, I will select my top five projects to add to my portfolio and eventually scale them into full-stack applications.
